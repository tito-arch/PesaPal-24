# Intro

I think the world is full of interesting problems. These are some nice challenges worth solving.

## Directory Structure

I want to try two of these problems that seem interesting to me. Since I have interacted with Git and Terminal applications, this is an opportunity to take a deep dive.

* The `Git` app is in the `dscs` (_Distributed Source Control System_) directory, and the `Z-Terminal-App` is in its respective directory.

* I will probably make more progress on the Git app, but I will try my best to succeed in both and, even better, take this to the next level. Whether I do that or not, we shall find out!

* Both apps have their `ReadMe` files.
